      ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Hassan, and I'm a Senior Software Engineer at
      <a href="https://github.com/" style="color: #007acc;">GitHub</a>.
      I've been based in Germany since 2021. I'm a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians_in_Lebanon" style="color: #007acc;">Palestinian-Lebanese</a>
      who grew up in a lovely city called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidon" style="color: #007acc;">Saida</a>, on the southern coast of Lebanon.
      I'm a husband, a good friend to those around me, and the proud owner of a cool feline named Shadow.
      In my free time, I enjoy binge-watching shows, meeting new people, and occasionally cooking.
      I've always been hesitant to share my thoughts, worrying about people's judgment. However, very recently (as of writing this), I decided to step out of my comfort zone and start writing.
      I hope you'll join me on this journey as I share my experiences, insights, and musings on everything from tech and career challenges to everyday adventures. After all, life's too short not to share our stories! ðŸ¤—
