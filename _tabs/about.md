ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Hassan, and I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com/).
I've been based in Germany since 2021. I'm a [Palestinian-Lebanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians_in_Lebanon) who grew up in a lovely city called [Saida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidon), on the southern coast of Lebanon.
I'm a husband, a good friend to those around me, and the proud owner of a cool feline named Shadow.
In my free time, I enjoy binge-watching shows, meeting new people, and occasionally cooking.

Iâ€™ve always been hesitant to share my thoughts, worrying about people's judgment. However, very recently (as of writing this), I decided to step out of my comfort zone and start writing.
I hope you'll join me on this journey as I share my experiences, insights, and musings on everything from tech and career challenges to everyday adventures. After all, lifeâ€™s too short not to share our stories! ðŸ¤—
